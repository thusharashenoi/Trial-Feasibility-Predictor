# Trial Success Classification

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify trial outcomes as successful or unsuccessful. The primary objective is to analyze features, identify key patterns, and create a robust model that predicts trial success with high accuracy. 

### **Key Features**
- **Objective**: Predict the success of trials based on input features.
- **Data**: Includes features related to trial setups, outcomes, and other influencing factors.
- **Methodology**:
  - Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
  - Model training and hyperparameter optimization.
  - Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
